# Gesture-Recognition-Case-Study


### Problem Statement
As a data scientist at a home electronics company which manufactures state of the art smart televisions. We want to develop a cool feature in the smart-TV that can recognise five different gestures performed by the user which will help users control the TV without using a remote. 
•	Thumbs up		:  Increase the volume.
•	Thumbs down		: Decrease the volume.
•	Left swipe		: 'Jump' backwards 10 seconds.
•	Right swipe		: 'Jump' forward 10 seconds. 
•	Stop			: Pause the movie. 

### Understanding the Dataset
The training data consists of a few hundred videos categorized into one of the five classes. Each video (typically 2-3 seconds long) is divided into a sequence of 30 frames (images). These videos have been recorded by various people performing one of the five gestures in front of a webcam - similar to what the smart TV will use.
